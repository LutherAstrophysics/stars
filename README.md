This repo houses any documentation, comment about any particular star
through the use of github issues in this repo. New comments can be
added to any particular star by visiting the star's page in our LC
website. For example to see the comments for start 1, and add new
comments, visit http://10.30.5.4:2300/lc/1. 

Also note that the rationale for using git issues and not using our
own database is because we don't have a robust backend that is always
backed up. Therefore we needed a system that we could be sure won't go
down easily and we don't lose our work.

This repo is public, and any github user will be able to make new
comments, and create new issues. Hopefully we won't get any spam. If
we start getting spams, we will have to consider making the repo
privae, which includes a bit more setup on our part, like setting up a
github app that is authorized to get access to the comments and
linking that github app to the LC website.
